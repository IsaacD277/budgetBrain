# budgetBrain
a budgeting app that makes sense to me. All the other ones don't do what I want them to.

### Origin
I have tried just about every budgeting app out there, but none of them seem to work as my brain does for a budget. After getting frustrated that they don't work as I would like, I end up back in Excel trying to figure out where my money should go. This led me to begin the process of building the app so that I can finally keep track of my money as I would like.

### How my brain works (And therefore the logic of the app)
Essentially, I just want to have my categories roll over every month. When I get paid $20, I can split it up how I want (or can follow general guidelines I set, such as tithing 10%) and then assign transactions to each category that will subtract. I would still like to be able to see general guidelines on how much I have left to spend each month, but they are not hard and fast. I'll have to make a graphic or something that can demonstrate what I mean at some point, but since its currently just a passion project, I'll save the hassle for now.

### Conclusion
If this project interests you, I'd love some help. I'm just learning about SwiftUI and end up googling or ChatGPTing a lot of stuff.
